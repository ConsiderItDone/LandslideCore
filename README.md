# LandslideCore: A Tendermint Subnet on Avalanche

![picture alt](https://media.publit.io/file/Landslide/Landslide-Background.png "Landslide")

The Landslide Network is an Avalanche Subnet which decreases the finality of Tendermint consensus, and will port over the majority of the Cosmos and Terra ecosystems via an opensource Cosmwasm SDK to run any Tendermint-based dApp natively within the AVAX ecosystem.

Finality on Tendermint will be reduced to subsecond.

This new Cosmwasm SDK can be used to develop games, AMMs, and other dapps that require high throughput and scalability that are currently unavailable on Cosmos or Terra due to the slow finality of Tendermint consensus.

# Goals
* Decrease the finality of transactions on Tendermint from 7-22 seconds to under 1 second.
* Fork/port existing Cosmos and Terra dApps to the subnet.
* Take advantage of trading opportunities created by the faster finality times.
* 99% compatible out-of-the-box with native Cosmos-based SDK.
* Create a closer collaboration between the three ecosystems of Avalanche, Terra, and Cosmos.
* Airdrop tokens to the most amount users on Avalanche, Terra, and Cosmos.

# Motivation
The large scale adoption of Tendermint is entirely dependent on Tendermint consensus. While rollups do present a potential soluiton to TPS, they present centralized security risks.
With a Tendermint module and Avalanche consensus, now the Cosmos and Terra ecosystems will be able to build entire realm of metaverse, gaming, and trading applications that were formerly impossible to scale.

# Network Characteristics
* Be accessible via the Terra Station, Keplr, and Core AVAX wallets.
* Integrate the Cosmos IBC via Tendermint/Avalanche SDK.
  * This will help facilitate swaps between AVAX and ATOM when atomic swaps between subnets go live on Avalanche in Q4 2022.
* All $LUNA, $ATOM, and $AVAX balances, and instances will be replaced with $SLIDE tokens.
* The balances will be logarithmically adjusted to ensure a fair distribution.
* UST will not be forked to Landslide.
* Fork most Terra and Cosmos tokens and Dapps into the subnet.
* Stock tokens from Mirror will be frozen until the Landslide DAO, or the Foundation, votes to unfreeze these assets (which may or may not occur) based on the legal risk and Foundation policies.
* Create a custom open source Avalanche-Cosmos SDK merging the Cosmos SDK with the Avalanche SDK.
* Innovative inflationary network fees are being discussed in addition to the native $AVAX burning mechanism.
* Fees may be split between being burned (similar to AVAX), and being sent to popular network apps via token holders (similar to Archway).
* These parameters will be governed by the voting similar to current native Terra voting.
* Require Landslide Validators to be validators on AVAX mainnet.
